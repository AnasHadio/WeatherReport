# WeatherReport

This program was to understand and learn how to use APIs as well as AJAX code. I used Openweathermap API to get a weather report for a zip code. Zip Code is compared with APIâ€™s zip codes to see if there is a match. Displays: city, coordinates, weather, description, humidity, wind speed, sunrise time, and current time.
